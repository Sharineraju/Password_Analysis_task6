# 🔐 Cyber Security Internship – Task 6  
## 🧩 Create a Strong Password and Evaluate Its Strength  

### 🎯 Objective  
The goal of this task is to understand what makes a password strong, how password complexity affects security, and how different password structures perform when tested with online password strength tools.

---

### 🧰 Tools Used  
- **[PasswordMeter.com](https://passwordmeter.com)** – Checks password strength based on length, symbols, numbers, and uppercase/lowercase mix.  
- **[Security.org Password Checker](https://www.security.org/how-secure-is-my-password/)** – Estimates the time required to crack a password through brute force.

---

### ⚙️ Process  
1. Created multiple passwords with different complexity levels (weak, medium, strong, passphrase).  
2. Tested each password using both online tools.  
3. Recorded the password strength percentage, estimated crack time, and feedback.  
4. Compared the results to understand how complexity improves security.

### 📊 Results and Comparison  

| Password | Strength (%) | Rating | Estimated Time to Crack | Feedback |
|-----------|---------------|---------|--------------------------|-----------|
| `password123` | 43% | Weak | Few seconds | Too common, lacks special characters |
| `MyPass#25` | 80% | Strong | Hundreds of years | Strong mix but predictable pattern |
| `G!tH#b_S3cur3@Task6` | 100% | Very Strong | Millions of years | Excellent randomness and complexity |
| `CyberDogsRun@Night2025` | 100% | Very Strong | Millions of years | Strong passphrase, long and unpredictable |

---

### 💡 Key Learnings  
- Password strength increases with **length, complexity, and unpredictability**.  
- Avoid using **dictionary words**, names, or personal information.  
- Always use a mix of **uppercase**, **lowercase**, **numbers**, and **symbols**.  
- Strong passwords alone are not enough — enable **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)** for added protection.  
- Password managers are effective tools for storing complex passwords securely.  

---

### ⚠️ Common Password Attacks  
1. **Brute Force Attack:** Tries every possible combination until the password is cracked.  
2. **Dictionary Attack:** Uses common words or previously leaked passwords.  
3. **Phishing:** Tricks users into revealing passwords through fake websites or emails.  
4. **Credential Stuffing:** Reuses stolen passwords from one site on other platforms.  

---

### 🛡️ Best Practices  
- Use at least **12–16 characters**.  
- Combine **letters, numbers, and special characters**.  
- Avoid personal or predictable information.  
- Do **not reuse passwords** across multiple accounts.  
- Change passwords regularly and enable **MFA/2FA**.  
- Use **passphrases** for stronger and more memorable security.  

---

### 🧾 Outcome  
Through this activity, I learned how password complexity directly impacts its resistance to cracking attempts.  
This task improved my understanding of **password security**, **authentication techniques**, and **best practices** that protect users from cyber threats.
